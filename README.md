# RegWave
**Regulatory Intelligence Platform for Financial Services Compliance**

RegWave aggregates, classifies, and summarizes regulatory updates from major US regulators — 
helping compliance teams stay current without manually monitoring government of sources.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This platform **fully automates** the collection, AI-processing, and structured review of regulatory updates and enforcement actions from all major U.S. financial regulators. It monitors for:

- **BSA** — Bank Secrecy Act
- **AML** — Anti-Money Laundering
- **KYC** — Know Your Customer
- **ABC** — Anti-Bribery & Corruption
- **Fraud** fines & enforcement actions
- **Regulatory developments** across financial services

The system runs **completely automatically**, every morning before business hours, and routes processed data through a structured compliance review workflow with defined user roles.

> **💰 Cost: $0 under current free-tier limits. The system is designed to operate entirely within free tiers, though higher volume or API usage may require upgrades.**

## 🏛️ Regulatory Sources

The platform monitors **8 major U.S. regulatory agencies** across **9 automated workflows**. FDIC and the Federal Reserve each have two separate feeds (news and speeches), resulting in 8 workflows from 8 agencies (plus one error handler):

| Source | Type | Collection Method |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **FDIC** | News & Speeches | Manual crawl |
| **FinCEN** | News & Guidance | Manual crawl |
| **OCC** | News, Bulletins & Speeches | RSS + parse + PDF extraction |
| **U.S. Treasury** | News | Manual crawl |
| **FINRA** | News & Enforcement | Manual crawl |
| **Federal Reserve** | News & Speeches | RSS + parse |
| **SEC** | Press Releases | RSS + parse |
| **FFIEC** | Press Releases | Tavily search |

> **Note:** Tavily is used **exclusively** for FFIEC. All other sources use direct crawling, HTML parsing, and content cleaning pipelines. OCC speeches are published as PDFs — these are handled via a dedicated PDF extraction branch (see Workflow 4).

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🔹 n8n — Automation Engine
**What it is:** An open-source workflow automation platform (like Zapier but self-hosted and free).

**What it does in this project:**
- Triggers all workflows on a daily schedule (5:00–5:35 AM ET, staggered every 5 minutes)
- Fetches and parses regulatory content from all 8 agencies across 9 workflows
- Calls AI APIs for classification and summarization
- Checks Supabase for duplicates before processing
- Writes processed articles to the database
- Sends Telegram alerts when any workflow fails

**Deployment:** Self-hosted in Docker on Oracle Cloud free tier VPS, accessed securely via Caddy reverse proxy over HTTPS.

---

### 🔹 Caddy — Reverse Proxy & HTTPS
**What it is:** A lightweight, open-source web server that automatically handles SSL certificate provisioning and renewal.

**What it does in this project:**
- Sits in front of n8n and handles all incoming HTTPS traffic
- Automatically obtained a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt on first startup
- Auto-renews the certificate before expiry — zero manual maintenance ever

**Why Caddy instead of Nginx:**
- Zero-config SSL — just specify the domain name and it handles everything
- No manual certificate renewal commands
- Minimal resource usage (~13MB RAM)

---

### 🔹 Tavily — AI-Optimized Search (FFIEC only)
**What it is:** A search engine built specifically for AI/LLM workflows. Unlike traditional web scraping, Tavily returns clean, structured JSON results.

**Why used for FFIEC specifically:**
- FFIEC's website structure is complex to scrape reliably
- Tavily returns pre-structured results (title, URL, date, content) without custom parsing logic
- Reduces code complexity for this one source

**What it returns:**
```json
{
  "title": "FFIEC Releases Revised BSA/AML Examination Manual",
  "url": "https://www.ffiec.gov/press/...",
  "published_date": "2026-04-01",
  "content": "..."
}
```

---

### 🔹 Supabase — Database & Authentication
**What it is:** An open-source Firebase alternative built on PostgreSQL.

**What it stores:**
- All processed regulatory articles
- AI-generated categories and summaries
- Full article text
- Source metadata (regulator, date, URL)
- User decisions (approve/decline/unsure) with notes
- Decision history and timestamps

**Why Supabase:**
- Free tier is generous (500MB database, unlimited API calls)
- Built-in authentication for multi-user login
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for role-based data access
- Real-time API accessible from the frontend

---

### 🔹 Oracle Cloud — Backend Hosting
**What it is:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Always Free tier provides a permanent, always-on virtual server.

**Specs used:**
- VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro (1 OCPU, 1GB RAM)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- 50GB boot volume
- 4GB swap file

**What runs on it:**
- n8n (Docker container)
- Caddy (reverse proxy + SSL termination)
- All 8 source workflows + error handler

---

### 🔹 Netlify — Frontend Hosting
**What it is:** A free static site hosting platform with GitHub auto-deployment.

**What it hosts:**
- The compliance review web interface
- Connected directly to Supabase for data and auth
- Auto-deploys on every GitHub push

**Important:** Netlify connects directly to Supabase — it does NOT connect to n8n. n8n writes data to Supabase on its own schedule. Netlify independently reads from and writes decisions to the same Supabase database.

---

### 🔹 AI Models — Classification & Summarization

**Primary:** Groq API — `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
- Fast inference, free tier with generous limits
- Primary model for all 10 workflows

**Fallback:** OpenRouter — `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001`
- Activates automatically if Groq hits rate limits
- Different company/infrastructure = fully independent rate limits
- Free tier on OpenRouter

**Why dual providers:** If Groq experiences rate limits or downtime, OpenRouter automatically takes over — no manual intervention needed. Both providers serve capable models for free.

**What the AI does for each article:**
1. Classifies into exactly ONE category:
   - BSA/AML/KYC Fines & Enforcement
   - Regulatory Updates
   - Regulator Speeches & Testimony
   - Industry News & Trends
2. Writes a 2-sentence plain-English summary for compliance officers

**Enhanced AI Classification Prompt v2:**
Rewrote the n8n classification prompt with explicit decision rules, keyword anchors, and a priority hierarchy to reduce misclassification. Added a KEY TEST heuristic ("Does this article tell a compliance officer they must do something new?") to better distinguish true regulatory updates from program announcements, statistics, and industry news.

Manual reclassification — users can now correct AI-assigned categories from the UI; original AI classification is retained in the database for audit purposes and flagged visually in the review queue.

---

## ⚠️ Failure Handling

The system is designed to fail safely and visibly:

- Duplicate articles → skipped automatically  
- AI failures → fallback provider is triggered  
- Source errors → workflow fails and sends Telegram alert  
- Parsing failures → article is skipped (no partial data stored)  

A global error workflow ensures **no silent failures**.

---

### 🔹 Telegram — Error Monitoring
A dedicated n8n error handler workflow sends real-time alerts to a Telegram bot whenever any workflow fails, including:
- Which workflow failed
- Which node failed
- The error message

This ensures failures are immediately visible and actionable.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- URL-based deduplication assumes one URL per unique article  
- HTML parsing depends on regulator website structure (can break if layout changes)  
- FFIEC relies on Tavily search rather than direct scraping  
- AI classification can be deterministic (manual override option is available)
- OCC PDF extraction depends on n8n's built-in Extract From File node; scanned/image PDFs will not extract correctly

These are acceptable trade-offs for a lightweight, free-tier system.

---

## 🔁 Deduplication Logic

The system uses a **two-layer deduplication strategy**:

1. **Pre-processing deduplication (workflow level)**  
   Each workflow checks whether an article URL already exists in Supabase before sending it to AI. This prevents unnecessary API calls and reduces token usage.

2. **Database-level protection (Supabase)**  
   The `url` field is enforced as unique, ensuring no duplicate records are ever stored, even if multiple workflows run concurrently.

## 🗃️ Database Schema (Supabase)

### `items` table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | uuid | Primary key |
| `title` | text | Article title |
| `url` | text | Source URL (unique) |
| `source` | text | Regulator name (e.g., "FDIC") |
| `date_published` | date | Publication date |
| `category` | text | AI-assigned category |
| `summary` | text | AI-generated 2-sentence summary |
| `full_text` | text | Cleaned article content |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When added to DB |

### `decisions` table (frontend)
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | uuid | Primary key |
| `item_id` | uuid | FK to items |
| `user_id` | uuid | FK to auth.users |
| `decision` | text | approve / decline / unsure |
| `notes` | text | User notes |
| `created_at` | timestamp | Decision timestamp |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | Last modified |

---

## 👥 User Roles & Review Workflow

### 🟢 Doer
- Sees **ALL** incoming articles
- For each article must select:
  - ✅ **Approve** — relevant, should be escalated
  - ❌ **Decline** — not relevant
  - ❓ **Unsure** — needs second opinion
- Can add notes to any item
- Primary focus: approve or unsure (decline is available but secondary)

### 🔵 Reviewer
- Sees **ONLY** items marked `Approve` or `Unsure` by Doer
- Cannot see `Declined` items
- Can add their own notes
- Validates Doer decisions

### 🟣 Approver *(optional extension)*
- Final authority
- Confirms or overrides decisions
- Full audit trail

### Business Rule
For each of the regulatory categories, the Doer must make a decision. The system enforces that `Approve` and `Unsure` items flow to the Reviewer queue. All decisions are stored permanently with timestamps and user attribution.

---

## 💻 Frontend (Web Interface)

**Hosting:** Netlify (free, auto-deploys from GitHub)  
**Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/password, multi-user)  
**Data:** Direct Supabase API connection 

### Features:
- Multi-user login with role-based access
- Dashboard styled
- Article list with category badges and AI summaries
- Per-article decision panel (Approve / Decline / Unsure buttons)
- Notes field per article
- Filters by: Category, Status, Date range, Source
- Reviewer queue (filtered view — approved/unsure only)
- Fully responsive (works on mobile)

## 🔧 Optimizations

### Server RAM Optimizations (Oracle Free Tier)

| Optimization | RAM Saved | Safe? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remove Snap | ~150MB | ✅ | Largest single win |
| Remove oracle-cloud-agent | ~50MB | ✅ | Removed automatically with snap; Oracle metrics stop but instance runs fine |
| Disable multipathd | ~27MB | ✅ | Multi-path disk manager, not needed on single-disk VPS |
| Disable apport + whoopsie | ~15MB | ✅ | Ubuntu crash reporters, useless on a server |
| Limit journald to 50MB | variable | ✅ | Prevents log files from consuming unbounded RAM |
| 4GB swap file | prevents crashes | ✅ | Emergency RAM overflow buffer; n8n spills into swap instead of crashing |
| `restart: always` in Docker | reliability | ✅ | n8n auto-restarts after any crash or server reboot |
| RAM logging cron job | visibility | ✅ | Logs `free -m` every minute to `~/ram_log.txt` |
| Do NOT limit Node.js memory | n/a | ✅ | Swap handles overflow; capping Node causes workflow crashes |

```

### Workflow Optimizations

- **Staggered triggers** — workflows run every 5 minutes from 5:00–5:35 AM to avoid simultaneous API hammering
- **Deduplication before AI** — AI is only called for genuinely new articles (saves API costs and rate limits)
- **Dynamic year in URLs** — all listing URLs use `new Date().getFullYear()` expression so no code changes are needed each January
- **Dual AI provider** — Groq primary + OpenRouter fallback prevents rate limit failures; two independent providers with separate limits
- **OCC PDF routing** — URL-based If node splits PDF and HTML articles before fetching, avoiding binary/text confusion downstream; n8n's built-in Extract From File node handles PDF text extraction with no external dependencies
